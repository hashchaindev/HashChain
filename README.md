# HashChain
HashChain can be used to create chains of timestamped hashes. These hashes can create a trusted time-stamping system where consecutive signatures can be linked together. Once two hashes have been linked they cannot be unlinked. This allows for a historical record which could be used to build a reputation or identity.
